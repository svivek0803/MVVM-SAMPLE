#Expatland App
Expatland is an iOS application designed to showcase modern iOS development practices. The app is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, integrated with the Realm database for local data storage, and leverages PromiseKit for efficient and clean API management. 

#Features
MVVM Architecture: Ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, testable, and maintainable.
Realm Database: Provides a fast and reliable local data storage solution, enabling seamless offline capabilities and efficient data handling.
PromiseKit: Simplifies asynchronous programming with promises, making API calls and other asynchronous tasks cleaner and more readable.

Technologies Used
Swift: The main programming language used for development.
Realm: Used for local data persistence.
PromiseKit: Used for managing asynchronous operations and API calls.
